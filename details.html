          <h3>Project Deadline: Push your final project to GitHub no later than Friday, March 29th by noon!</h3>
          There will be a simple survey/form provided approximately 2 weeks prior to the due date that you will complete to “turn-in” your project.<br>
          <p><strong>Late projects will not be accepted.</strong></p>

          <p>The purpose of the capstone project is to reinforce what you’ve learned and show off your skills. Your projects will be your go-to tool to show off to potential employers and demonstrate you know what you’re talking about. Pick an idea that is fun, challenging, and hopefully useful, too!
          Create a website that demonstrates your knowledge of the Front-end development skills you’ve been learning. This application can be anything of your choosing as long as it demonstrates the below principles and requirements.</p>

          <p>Your project does not need to be “complete” in that it doesn’t need to be a fully-functioning, finalized project ready to be launched. It can be a small, simple site that only has a few features. It can even have incomplete features, so long as somewhere on the page it still meets all the below requirements. The important point is that you demonstrate good coding practices and the major platforms you learned in the course. You can always add on to your project after the end of the class.</p>
          <h3>Project Template:</h3>
          <p>A blank project that includes a folder structure, a blank readme, and some best practices has been created and made available to work off of. You are encouraged (but not required) to follow this example. It can be found here: https://github.com/CodeLouisville/front-end-template
          Feel free to fork (copy) this project to your own GitHub portfolio and use it to start all of the front-end projects you work on.</P>

        <p>
          You are highly encouraged to include a front-end framework such as AJAX, jQuery, or Angular in your project as a demonstration of your ability to utilize these. However, this is not a requirement of a passing project
          You are also highly encouraged to add some form of user interactivity to your project where something responds to an action the user performs. However, this is also not a requirement of passing
          No “asset swap” projects - meaning, you cannot take a working project (such as a Treehouse sample project) and change the name, colors, or other superficial properties
          Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to host your application on a live URL, GREAT! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.
          Check out GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) for a quick way to host your site
          README File
          You CANNOT re-use a project provided on Treehouse, from another student, or a completed project you found online
          While taking inspiration, ideas, and code snippets from other projects is a normal part of the software development process, the complete re-use of an existing project is unacceptable
          Any project which simply takes code from one of the projects that Treehouse provided and modifies a few elements (colors, images, names, etc) will not be accepted. You are expected to create a new project for your portfolio
          Testing Your Project
          You should test your project on another computer by having someone else obtain and run your project. Several projects in the past have failed to meet requirements because it was written in a way that only worked on that person's computer and not the reviewer's. Your project reviewer will not be responsible for tracking down why your project does not work and this may result in a failed project.
          Mentors
          You should talk about your project early and often with your mentors. Explain your idea and the features you are thinking of implementing. They will help you understand if it will meet the requirements or if you've possibly decided to tackle too large of a project for the 12-week time period. Towards the end of the session, you should again show your project to your mentors and get confirmation that it meets the requirements of the project. You are perfectly fine to ask them to confirm so there should be no surprises about whether your project will meet the requirements when it comes time to submit.
