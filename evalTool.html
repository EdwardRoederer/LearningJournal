                <div class="reqDesc">
                  Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way based on what type of device the project is viewed from. The user experience must be improved in some way through your responsive design. See below for clarifications on this requirement.
                  <div class ="reqClar">
                    <p>
                      Your site/app should improve user experience with its responsive design, such as making the page easier to view or read, rearranging content, changing the size of content, etc.
                      Swapping the color of your font or changing a background image/color is not demonstrating an improved experience and will not count.
                      The two most common (but not the only) methods of accomplishing responsive design are:
                      CSS media/device queries that will change elements on your page above or below certain screen sizes
                      Using a framework (such as Bootstrap) to implement responsive design
                      You do not have to account for all possible devices and browser sizes, just demonstrate some responsive layout principles
                      Adding 100% width to an image or content area will not be enough to qualify for this requirement for Code Louisville
                      This will essentially be tested for by using the Chrome Dev Tools to simulate a mobile device view in a browser as well as by looking at your code

          <p> <input class="req" type="checkbox" name="Req01" value="Complete">
                <div class="reqDesc">
                  Your project includes at least 3 custom-written CSS selectors/rules in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
                  <div class ="reqClar">
                    <p>
                      These selectors/rules MUST be located in a separate .css file you created. It cannot be 'inline' CSS found only within your HTML elements
                      Using ONLY Bootstrap for your customization does not fulfill this requirement
                      You are highly encouraged to use a variety of CSS styles to enrich your site, 3 is just a bare minimum. Most sites will have dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of CSS elements
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>

          <p> <input class="req" type="checkbox" name="Req01" value="Complete">
                <div class="reqDesc">
                  Your project includes custom-written JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function (jQuery is fine as well) located in a .js file.
                  Exception: using only alert() or prompt() will not meet this requirement
                  <div class ="reqClar">
                    <p>
                      You must include some form of JavaScript written by you, and must be included in a separate .js file in your project (no inline JavaScript)
                      It must include at minimum 1 working JavaScript function
                      Using a JavaScript framework such as AJAX, Angular, or jQuery can certainly meet this requirement
                      Just importing/linking Bootstrap (or other frameworks) does not meet this requirement

                  Your code has some comments noting major portions of your code
                  <div class ="reqClar">
                    <p>
                      Every line doesn’t need a comment, but major sections of your CSS, HTML, and/or JavaScript files should have some helpful comments so a reviewer can know what the major parts of your code do and more easily read it

                      Choose a name for your GitHub repo that is relevant to the subject of your project, meaning do not name your repo "CodeLouisvilleProject" or similar. Choose a name based on what your project is about. For example “Brian’s House of Pancakes”, “Personal Portfolio Site”, etc
